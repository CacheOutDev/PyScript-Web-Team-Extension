# PyScript Web Team Extension (Work In-Progress)

I've been experimenting with the PyScript library, specifically with Pete Fison's tutorial (linked below).
The goal of this project is to create a browser extension that runs Python script.
So far, I've been able to structure the UI. However, I've been facing issues with importing Python libraries.
